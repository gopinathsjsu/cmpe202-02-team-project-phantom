# Root .env.example file for docker-compose.yml port mappings
# Copy this file to .env and update with your actual port values
# Docker Compose reads these variables for port mappings in docker-compose.yml
# Each service's own .env file (in their respective directories) provides service-specific configuration

# Orchestrator service port (for docker-compose port mapping)
# This should match PORT in orchestrator/.env
PORT=8080

# Listing service port (for docker-compose port mapping)
# This should match LISTING_PORT in listing-service/.env
LISTING_PORT=8081

# Events server port (for docker-compose port mapping)
# events-server/.env has PORT=:8001 (with colon prefix), but port mapping needs just the number
# This should match the numeric part of PORT in events-server/.env
EVENTS_PORT=8001

# Optional: Override DATABASE_URL if needed
# If set, this will override DATABASE_URL in service-specific .env files
# DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here

# Frontend port (for docker-compose port mapping)
# This matches the port the frontend service will use
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
