# XP Core Values Demonstrated by the Team

## Communication

Communication was a major strength of the team throughout the project. Because the system had many interconnected pieces—frontend, backend, real-time messaging, database services, and deployment—the group needed to stay aligned at all times.

### How We Followed This Value
- **Cross-functional coordination:**  
  Features like chat, listings, search, and admin tools required backend and frontend work to fit together. The team checked in often to make sure APIs, schemas, and UI expectations matched.

- **Frequent integration:**  
  Regular merges and integration testing helped catch issues early. This required open communication about what was changing and how it affected others.

- **Clear ownership:**  
  Each team member had different responsibilities, which made communication important to ensure compatibility across services.

- **Open discussion of blockers:**  
  Issues such as chat UI waiting on WebSocket stability, or admin dashboards needing backend routes, were communicated early so other members could respond.

### Impact  
Communication helped maintain steady progress, reduced delays, and made it possible to connect all components into a fully working application.

## Feedback

The team also made strong use of feedback—both from internal testing and from how the system behaved—to refine features and improve the overall product.

### How We Followed This Value
- **Short, focused sprints:**  
  Each sprint produced new working features, allowing the team to identify issues quickly and make informed adjustments in the next sprint.

- **Iterative improvements:**  
  Core systems like messaging, search, and listing management went through multiple rounds of refinement based on practical testing and feedback from teammates.

- **Responding to real system behavior:**  
  Bugs such as message delivery issues, media upload failures, or search inconsistencies were discovered and fixed after hands-on testing.

- **Deployment feedback:**  
  When Neon or AWS deployment produced errors (such as SSL mode issues or compose failures), the team updated configurations, scripts, and documentation accordingly.

### Impact  
This continuous feedback loop helped the team fix issues early, polish the user experience, and ship a more stable, reliable final application.

## Final Summary

Of the XP values, Communication and Feedback were the most evident throughout the project. Strong communication enabled smooth cross-team coordination, while continuous feedback allowed quick iteration and improvement. Together, these values helped the team deliver a complete, deployed marketplace system.
